# Python Knowledge Store/Share

Thematic Python playground repository for storing and sharing everything 
    that is Python.
Materials are structured as much as possible although sometimes overlaps
    are hard to eliminate.

### Data Science - `pythonks.ds`
This package hosts everything that explicitly concerns the data science
    stack.

- `pythonks.ds.ai`: **Artificial Intelligence** gives room to most of
  machine and deep learning content
- `pythonks.ds.anf`: in **Arrays and Frames** you will find NumPy and 
  Pandas' materials
- `pythonks.ds.projects`: this is the place for small to moderate
  size individual projects
